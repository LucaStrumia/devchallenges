      ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the<br> bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
      transition<br> and have heard some people who had an<br> amazing experience here. I signed up 
      for the<br> free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I<br> enrolled shortly thereafter. 
      The next 12 weeks<br> was the best - and most grueling - time of my<br> life. Since completing 
      the course, I‚Äôve<br> successfully switched careers, working as a <br>Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

      ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
      professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
      student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
      did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
      project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
      could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
      experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
      100% recommend! ‚Äù
